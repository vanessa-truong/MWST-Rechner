# MWST-Rechner

Overview:
The Mehrwertsteuer-Rechner, or VAT Calculator, is a web-based application designed to calculate Value Added Tax (VAT) in both the "Netto zu Brutto" (Net to Gross) and "Brutto zu Netto" (Gross to Net) scenarios. It also allows users to select different VAT rates, specifically 19% or 7%. This project was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for VAT calculations.

### Technical Details:

HTML Structure:

The project uses HTML for structuring the web page. It includes headings, forms, radio buttons, labels, input fields, and result display sections.
CSS Styling:

CSS is applied to style the HTML elements and make the user interface visually appealing.
It defines fonts, colors, button styles, and responsive design elements for a better user experience.


JavaScript Functions:
The core functionality of the VAT Calculator is implemented using JavaScript.

Two main functions are defined:
changeText(): This function dynamically updates text based on whether the user wants to calculate from "Netto to Brutto" or "Brutto to Netto."
showResults(): This function calculates VAT and final amounts based on user input and selected VAT rate.


User Interaction:
Users can select the desired calculation mode (Netto to Brutto or Brutto to Netto) using radio buttons.
They can also choose the VAT rate (19% or 7%) using radio buttons.
Input fields allow users to enter the initial amount.
Clicking the "BERECHNEN" (CALCULATE) button triggers the calculations and displays the VAT amount and final amount.

Results Display:

The Mehrwertsteuerbetrag (VAT amount) and Endbetrag (final amount) are shown in Euro (â‚¬) with two decimal places.

Styling and Responsiveness:
The CSS styling ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
The project is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices for a consistent user experience.
